Produced Siobhan O'Laughlin's traveling Broken Bone Bathtub immersive show in New Orleans in 2019. My responsibilities included securing the set location, renting necessary props, and a combination of both set dressing, fabrication, and lighting for the show. I also created the poster for this run of her show in New Orleans and handled marketing and print advertising.
