For a site-specific installation I sculpted a series of eleven mushrooms from wood. For the mushroom caps, I glued and clamped a pair of poplar blocks to create a form that I could chisel the shape from. Creating a disc jig helped with this process. I hollowed the cap on a drill press and used thin wood strips discarded from a table saw to make wooden gills under the caps. I gathered some found wood branches that were satisfyingly twisted, spoke shaved them, and sanded them before attaching them to the underside of the caps.
