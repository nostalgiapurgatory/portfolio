In 2021, a festival-clothing store called [Rave Wonderland](https://www.ravewonderland.com/pages/in-store) on Pico Boulevard in Los Angeles was looking to thematically redesign their interior to look like a trendy, neon, semi-industrial fantasy space that was one part forest and one part city of the future.

A lot of ideas were generated during the meeting we shared with the client, so in order to put constraint on the project due to the client's budget and timeframe, yet still give her new elements that will help to sell merchandise and offer new branded experiences, we presented the following as focus areas: 
Shoe Area, Selfie Area, Mural, Lighting

For the initial impression of the space, we wanted to transition from a "glitchy" forest that could play with the lighting and feel immersive, so I designed a cut translucent acrylic forest of trees that could surround the entrance and thin out as the store transitioned to a more urban environment toward the back. The layers of different acrylic colors would mix with one another from the perspective of the viewer for a kaleidoscopic impression of color that passes light from the store front into the store.

For the Shoe Area, I followed these notes to develop the following concept art:
- building a “frame” that looks like the “bridge" in the Roger Rabbit and #26 Beyond Human images below. 

- Disneyesque quality of color pulled from the Roger Rabbit example, glowing cold tones with areas of dripping or mottled rust.

- probably be made out of wood with dimensional rivets and scenically painted with regular and UV paints to look like metal.  

- IF it can be designed with forced perspective that would be great for it adds a funky dynamic look to the structure!

- add some swagging cables/power lines to add a bit more dimension and make it more grungy. 

- the shoes would be on glowing plexiglass shelf sections

- arched mirror center

- the area behind the shoes could have a sheen so there’s some glow but not super reflective... paint them a high gloss black, let lighting focus on the fabulous shoes. Black or a dark glossy oversized subway tile look.

Following these notes, I created this edit to the concept sketch:

- make the “steel frame” look more wonky/Roger Rabbit-ish

- seating: Make them a cluster of cubes with the glitchy patterns painted on them.
