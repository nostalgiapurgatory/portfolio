I created digital pixelart assets for a game by Elli Furedy that had a 64 x 128px monochromatic display. 
The game, Alleycats, is a digital augmented cops-and-robbers game, where the "wanted" player in a small festival will hide out and the "hunter" will go looking for them amongst the crowds. 
The game has physical handheld interfaces which have a mechanism by which one bounty hunter and one bounty, when confronted in person, connect to one another for a quick 3 second game. There is a coundown (3, 2, 1...) and then the first player with the fastest reflex to press a button on their device will win. For the hunted, this means they walk "free" until another bounty hunter picks up their profile. For the bounty hunter, this means going back to home base to aquire a new target.
