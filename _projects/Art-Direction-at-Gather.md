Gather is retro-RPG aesthetic proximity chat platform that runs in-browser.

In 2020, many creative theatrical productions moved online out due to necessity from the COVID-19 lockdowns. Some creatives made use of Zoom, but others used smaller platorms that allowed for interesting creative liberties. Gather became a popular choice among friends of mine in the Immersive Theatre crowd. I was invited to Terrence LeClere's birthday party in Gather; it was a lot of fun!

In the early days, the avatars weren't user-editable, but the map was totally customizable. I made a few spaces, then did some contract work making maps for folks using the platform for themed event spaces.

I even made a virtual coffee shop and posted the link on Twitter.

I kept the space open on my laptop while I was in my room, using it as if I were working from a coffee shop. I heard voices coming from my laptop one evening and looked up to find Phillip Wang, the CEO of Gather, serving people coffees from behind the counter roleplaying as a barista. A writer for WIRED magazine was also in the space, and she later wrote [an article](https://www.wired.com/story/zoom-parties-proximity-chat/) about Gather from the visit.

Shortly after that evening, I applied to Gather. I showed all the spaces I had made, did an art test and a few interviews with the Art Director at the time, Mark Carpenter. Looking back and laughing, I distinctly remember thinking to myself, "This platform is amazing, but their art could really use some help. I can help!" Years later, after some great projects, the growing of the team, a few promotions, the shrinking of the team, and a pivot from the company to focus on remote work as a use case for the platform to find profitability, I found myself in the position of Art Director myself.

Ultimately, after three years, Gather's leadership decided to lay off the rest of the art team-- myself included. Between when I started and when I left, I influenced and defined the evolution of the Gather art style to become something less referential to nostalgic video game assets, but which stayed constrained to pixelart. The result was a more professional and purely Gather style of identity-inclusive avatars and wearable features, objects, and world environments. I reshaped the color palette, set the bar for consistency and quality in the art the team produced, and set higher level goals for the art and maps departments as a whole.
