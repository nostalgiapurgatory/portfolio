I tried to recreate a "dusty miller" leaf out of steel though methods of welding and metalworking. The leaf sculpture is finished in Paint, Spray Adhesive, Wood Flour, and Soylent (food powder) for texture. To make the leaf body from steel I used a diacro metal bending tool, plasma cutter by hand, and MIG and OxyAcetylene gas welding.
