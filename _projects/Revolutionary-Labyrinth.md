The proposed structureÂ is a series of  13 revolving alcoves, each with a unique immersive installation to be found within. Built similarly to revolving darkroom doors, each rotating room is self-suspended by steel tube and floating in a routed track. Inside each cylinder is an installation designed by a different individual or small group of artists, of all kinds. The installations are multi-sensory in nature and should evoke themes of "multiverse" (the 2020 Burning Man theme), nostalgia, alternate universes or timelines. It is a revolving labyrinthine grid of installation artworks, each one leading to the next. Participants create unique pathways through the art for a repeatable experience through a multitude of built environments.
