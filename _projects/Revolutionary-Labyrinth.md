This concept, including budget and timeline for the scope of work, was submitted for honoraria grant consideration for Burning Man 2020, and was considered in the final round of applicants. 

The proposed structureÂ is a series of  13 revolving alcoves, each with a unique immersive installation to be found within. Built similarly to revolving darkroom doors, each rotating room is self-suspended by steel tube and floating in a routed track. Inside each cylinder is an installation designed by a different individual or small group of artists, of all kinds. The installations are multi-sensory in nature and should evoke themes of "multiverse" (the 2020 Burning Man theme), nostalgia, alternate universes or timelines. It is a revolving labyrinthine grid of installation artworks, each one leading to the next. Participants create unique pathways through the art for a repeatable experience through a multitude of built environments.
