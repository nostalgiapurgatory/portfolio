Installation Art Lounge 

One of my undergraduate student works in the interior architecture department of RISD allowed us the freedom to reimagine the downtown space at 204 Westminster St, Providence, RI into anything we choose. For my area of study, I chose to imagine this space as the site of an "Installation Art Lounge". 

One unusual thing about this location was that the back of the property had enough potential height for two floors, but the street level is positioned at a level that is around the midpoint between the two. I planned out a solution to maximize the space and have a lobby with a ticketing and reception counter behind two display windows, for seasonal window installations, and a large freight elevator installed behind the lobby that could go between level 1, 1.5 (Lobby), and 2. Bathrooms and an ADA compliant elevator would be in the far back of house, and in between would be an event space with a grand staircase rising upward in a corkscrew curve to a fully wrapping mezzanine.
