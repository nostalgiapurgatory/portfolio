This piece was made from deconstructed belle Ã©poque wallpaper, cut and arranged over a figure drawing. This work was shown in Rome as a sensory installation. The shelf held a brewed combination of nuts, dried fruit, and flowers encapsulated in a tea infuser, which filled the surrounding space with the aroma of fruit and honey.
